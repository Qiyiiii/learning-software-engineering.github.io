# Introduction To Automated Testing
## What is automated testing
### It is a Software Testing Technique to test and compare software's actual outcome with the expected outcome, which can be achieved by writing test scripts or using any [automation testing tool](https://www.guru99.com/automated-testing-tools.html).
## Why do we need automated testing 
- Preventing bugs, reducing development costs and improving performance
- Coorperate with [Manual Testing](https://www.javatpoint.com/manual-testing) to achieve best performance
## Advantages Compared to Manual Testing
- The biggest pro of automation testing over manual testing is that it allows you to do more testing in less time. It increases productivity and expands how much you can test.
- Automated testing reduces repetitive manual tasks during the testing phase
- Automated testing can actually deliver better results because of its ability for increased test coverage.

## Disadvantages of automated testing 
- Less flexible to handle complex and nuanced test scenarios
- Can't and shouldn't be used to test cases that occur infrequently, are high risk, or are subject to change
